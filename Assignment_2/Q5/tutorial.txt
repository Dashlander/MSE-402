Cassandra Tutorial

Name: Water between sheets of graphene
required files: nvt.inp spce.mcf spce.dat graphene.mcf graphene.xyz

Steps
0.  Open vmd. Open the Nanotube Builder (Extensions --> Modeling --> Nanotube
    Builder). Enter the following parameters:

    Edge length along x (nm): 5
    Edge length along y (nm): 5
    Number of layers: 4

1.  Open graphene.xyz in vmd. How many graphene sheets are there? How many 
    carbon atoms are there in total?
2.  Open graphene.mcf in a text editor. How many carbon atoms are listed?
3.  Open nvt.inp in a text editor and enter appropriate values for the 
    following options

    Run_Name:
    Seed_Info:
    Simulation_Length_Info:
      Prop_Freq
      Coord_Freq
      Run

4.  In a terminal, run command:

> cassandra.exe nvt.inp

5.  Open the log file in a text editor.
6.  Open xyz trajectory in vmd. In a terminal, run command:

> vmd -e ../../Scripts/box.tcl RUN_NAME.xyz -args RUN_NAME.H 3 1

7.  Plot the energy using the following command:

> python ../../Scripts/plot.py RUN_NAME.prp1
