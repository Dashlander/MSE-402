1. You can choose bash scripts (ones with '.sh' extension) for automating the simulations. Remember to choose an appropriate keyword in the Q1_pt.scf.template file to replace using the sed command. 


2. For the k-piont grid generation (Question 2), you can use the "Q2_qe_kpoints.sh" file with suitable modifications for choosing the range of k-point selections as asked in the question. 


3. You can use the grep and awk commands for selecting desired information from the simulation output. 


e.g. "grep -e 'total energy' pt.out | awk '{ print $5 }' > output.data" will output all occurrences of the words "total energy" from the file si.scf.out and further select the 5th column from all such lines and write it to the file "output.data". 


4. To run Q1, Q2 and Q3, type in the terminal "./name_of_.sh_file". If there is permission issue, type "chmod +x name_of_.sh_file" and rerun the previous command.
